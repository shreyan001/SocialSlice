## Project Overview

SocialSlice revolutionizes social wagering by combining AI verification with blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where users can wager on virtually anything. Our platform eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries and creates a seamless, Web2-like experience through NERO Chain's account abstraction technology.

**Vision**: To transform how friends engage with each other through wagers by removing friction, ensuring fair outcomes, and making the entire process enjoyable and accessible to everyoneâ€”even those with no prior blockchain experience.

## Problem & Solution

### Problem
Traditional social betting faces multiple challenges:
- Lack of trust in outcome verification
- No easy way to escrow funds between friends
- Complex blockchain interfaces deter mainstream users
- Limited to conventional outcomes like sports scores
- Requires same-currency transactions

### Solution
SocialSlice addresses these challenges through:
- AI-powered verification system for any wagerable outcome
- Smart contract escrow with multi-currency support
- Account abstraction for a gasless, Web2-like experience
- Automated, trustless settlement based on verified outcomes
- Multi-party wagering with flexible reward distributions

## Key Features

- **AI Escrow System**: LangGraph-powered verification of unconventional outcomes through multiple data sources
- **Gasless Experience**: NERO Chain's Paymaster handles all transaction fees
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Wager using any cryptocurrency or stablecoin, regardless of what others use
- **Social Agent Integration**: AI agent that helps users create and join wagers through conversational interfaces
- **Multi-Party Wagering**: Support for two-person bets, group challenges, and tournament-style competitions
- **Browser Monitoring**: Verify online activities and game outcomes through secure browser monitoring
- **Flexible Wager Types**: Support for winner-takes-all, proportional distribution, and team-based allocations

## Technical Architecture

SocialSlice leverages several cutting-edge technologies to deliver its unique value proposition:

![Architecture Flowchart](architecture_traction Implementation

SocialSlice leverages NERO Chain's Account Abstraction (AA) and Paymaster system to provide a seamless, Web2-like experience:

1. **Type 0 (Sponsored Transactions)**:
   - First-time user onboarding
   - Social login creation of AA wallets
   - User's first social wager creation

2. **Type 1 (ERC20 Gas Payment)**:
   - Standard wager creation and participation
   - Evidence submission for verification
   - Fund deposits into escrow contracts

3. **Type 2 (Post-payment Processing)**:
   - Batch settlements for multi-party wagers
   - Complex distribution of funds across winners
   - Power users with high transaction volume

The implementation follows ERC-4337 standards with custom Paymaster contracts that validate user operations based on platform policies. This eliminates gas fee complexity for users while allowing flexible payment options.

```solidity
// Example Paymaster implementation for SocialSlice
contract SocialSlicePaymaster is BasePaymaster {
    mapping(address => bool) private whitelist;
    
    function _validatePaymasterUserOp(
        PackedUserOperation calldata userOp,
        bytes32 userOpHash,
        uint256 maxCost
    )
        internal
        view
        override
        returns (bytes memory context, uint256 validationData)
    {
        // Implementation for validating user operations
    }
    
    // Additional functions for managing the paymaster
}
```

## AI Verification System

At the core of SocialSlice is our advanced AI verification system, built using LangGraph and LangChain:

![Verification Flowchart](verification-Agent System**:
   - Evidence Collection Agent: Gathers data from specified sources
   - Verification Agent: Analyzes evidence and determines outcomes
   - Risk Assessment Agent: Monitors for fraudulent activities
   - Settlement Agent: Executes fund distribution based on results

2. **Data Sources Integration**:
   - Browser-Use Agent: Monitors web activities for verification
   - Game API Integrations: Connects with popular game APIs
   - Blockchain Analytics: Tracks on-chain activity for verification
   - User-Submitted Evidence: Processes images, videos, and text

3. **Perplexity Sonar Integration**:
   - Real-time data analysis with 200,000-token context window
   - Cross-reference results from multiple sources
   - Advanced analysis of complex wager conditions

```python
# Example LangGraph implementation for verification workflow
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

class VerificationState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    evidence: list
    status: str

workflow = StateGraph(VerificationState)
# Define nodes and connections for the verification workflow
```

## User Experience

   - Invisible AA wallet creation
   - No seed phrases or complex setup

2. **Wager Creation**:
   - Intuitive interface for defining wager terms

   - AI-assisted verification method determination

3. **Participation**:
   - One-click wager acceptance
   - Gasless transactions through Paymaster
   - Real-time status updates

4. **Verification & Settlement**:

## Use Cases

### Gaming Tournaments

Alice organizes a Valorant tournament among 8 friends with a prize pool of $200. Each participant puts in $25, which is held in escrow. SocialSlice's AI Stream Monitor watches the matches through authorized streams and verifies results against the game's API. Once complete, funds are automatically distributed to the top 3 players based on their ranking, with no manual intervention needed.

### Trading Challenges

Bob and 5 colleagues bet on who can achieve the highest ROI on DEX trading in a week. Each contributes $50 in different stablecoins. SocialSlice's Wallet Tracker monitors their designated wallets' on-chain activities. The AI analyzes transaction data, calculates ROIs, and verifies results through cross-referencing blockchain data. The winner automatically receives the prize pool, with the platform handling all currency conversions.

### Fitness Competitions

Carol and her gym friends wager on who can lose the most weight percentage in a month. Each stakes $20 in their preferred currency. Participants submit weekly weigh-in photos through the app. The AI Image Analysis agent processes these photos to detect tampering and inconsistencies, while the Verification agent calculates percentage weight loss for fair comparison. The winner receives the pool automatically once verified.

### Sports Prediction Pools

Dave creates a World Cup prediction pool for 20 friends, each contributing $10. Participants predict various outcomes: champion, top scorer, most assists, etc. SocialSlice's Sports API Integration pulls official data after the tournament, and the AI analyzes each prediction against actual results. Points are awarded based on accuracy, and the prize is distributed proportionally to the top performers, with the platform handling gas fees via Type 2 Paymaster.
